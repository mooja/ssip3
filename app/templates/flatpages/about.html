    <h1 id="about-overview">Overview</h1>
    <p> Formed in the Spring of 2011, a group of neighbors gathered people from the 209 corridor (south of Kingston, NY) to discuss how they might help one another remain independent, strengthen their communities, and stay in their own homes. Our group relies on the volunteers--neighbor helping neighbor. We have nurses, business people, artists, homemakers, computer specialists, doctors, lawyers, educators--people with all kinds of skills.</p>

    <h2 id="about-who-are-we">Who are we?</h2>
    <p> We all need help at one time or another, and many people are hesitant to ask. To address this issue, our members are asked to indicate the ways in which they can help. Then a List Manager, available on our special phone, responds to calls for help by looking through the list to match the need with a volunteer. When you join, your name will be placed on the list to call, and of course, you will be able to ask for help.  </p>


    <h2 id="about-what-can-you-do">What can you do?</h2>
    <p> Read aloud-or make a phone call and check up on a neighbor. One person needed a ride to and from the doctor for treatment, another just needed someone to retrieve her walker from her basement, another needed a ride to a meeting at night. All kinds of neighborly help is possible: someone to walk the dog or water the plants. Or someone who enjoys walking, going to the movies or doing a puzzle together. Sociability is a big part of SSIP209.  </p>


    <h2 id="about-how-can-we-help">How can we help?</h2>
    <p> We recommend services providers such as contractors, handymen, electricians, yard men who offer our group discounts.  What we also discovered was that, in getting together regularly, we're always exchanging information that is making our lives easier and more enjoyable.  </p>


    <h2 id="about-where-do-we-meet">Where do we meet?</h2>
    <p> Once a week--9:30 a.m. we gather at a local coffee shop for coffee and  a chat for about an hour. Every Monday, from 2 to 3, we have a Yoga Class (small fee) at the Marbletown Community Center.  We also meet there on the third Thursday of the month, from 2 to 4 for all kinds of games (bridge, scrabble, etc).  Every Friday, we meet early for a walk.  Our members also celebrate birthdays of the month. The regular business meetings are usually held at lunchtime on the second Saturday of the month.  Call 845-706-0182 for further information.  </p>

    <h2 id="about-who-is-eligible">Who is eligible?</h2>
    <p> Although most of us are over 50 years of age, all men and women are welcome.  Our current group is clustered in the High Falls-Stone Ridge area.  Four other groups have formed:  SSIP Kingston, SSIP New Paltz, SSIP Taconic, and SSIP Tri-County.  We are helping other communities in the area to form similar local groups.  For information about these groups (or forming your own), call ViVi at 845-331-0155 or write Vvhlavsa@aol.com.  </p>

    <h2 id="about-how-much-is-membership">How much is membership?</h2>
    <p> Members pay $26.00/year April-March. The fee covers telephone service, mileage transportation stipends and paper costs. Scholarships are available for those who cannot afford the yearly fee.  </p>
